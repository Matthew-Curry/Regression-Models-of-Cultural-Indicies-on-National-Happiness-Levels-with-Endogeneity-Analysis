# Regression-Models-of-Cultural-Indicies-on-National-Happiness-Levels-with-Endogeneity-Analysis
This script compiles data from multiple excel files to create 3 separate regression models using cultural indices defined by Professor Geert Hofstede to explain national happiness levels from the 2018 world happiness report. The first model is a regression using just the cultural variables to explain happiness, while the later two models add features to limit omitted variable bias. Finally, the script includes several functions that analyze how statistical significance of the cultural indices changes between models to explain which omitted variables were responsible for the biased estimates and how they were responsible for such errors. The script "Happiness.py" currently has a few errors and was in effect the rough draft for the script, featuring additional code related to exploratory data analysis to examine potential issues with multicolinearity. The final script is "SimplifiedHappiness.py" which performs the afformentioned analysis.
